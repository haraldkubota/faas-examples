# FaaS examples

3 directories:

* AWS Lambda: AWS Lambda examples: counting primes and adding 2 numbers
* Google Cloud Functions: most examples are here
  * The GCF directory has a Tic Tac Toe implementation. That one also has some tests via Jest. So take it as a more complex but still simple example.
* WebTask: Auth0's WebTasks. Counting primes.
